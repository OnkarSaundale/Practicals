  <p>Technology is here to stay forever, and it would only continue to strengthen
    its grip over the business world in the years to come.
    Amidst such a situation, companies would continue requiring technology
    specialists, programmers, tester in large numbers.
    However, supporting this need and further fulfilling it will be possible
    only when the fundamental element of the entire ecosystem
    – education, would be correct, comprehensive, and focused.</p>
