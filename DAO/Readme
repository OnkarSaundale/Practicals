Data Access Object patterns, often known as DAO patterns, 
are used to divide high level business services from low level data accessing APIs or actions.
The members of the Data Access Object Pattern are listed below.

Data Access Object Interface: The Data Access Object Interface specifies the common operations to be carried out on a model object (s).

Concrete Data Access Object class: This class implements the aforementioned interface.
This class is in charge of obtaining data from a data source, which could be a database, XML, or another type of storage system.

Model or Value Object: This object is a straightforward POJO with get/set methods for storing data obtained using the DAO class.
